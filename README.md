# PoC for CVE-2024-0582

While learning about the iouring interface, I decided to create a PoC for [CVE-2024-0582](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0582). All of this work is derived directly from the CVE information, the [patch](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=c392cbecd8eca4c53f2bf508731257d9d0a21c2d) and a few other write ups related to io uring -- particularly Chompie's write up of [CVE-2021-41073](https://chomp.ie/Blog+Posts/Put+an+io_uring+on+it+-+Exploiting+the+Linux+Kernel).
